# Greennit Project for CS3141
### Description
This is a somewhat failed attempted clone of the site Reddit, which was supposed to include green but doesn't.

This project is made with Java Servlets and is run on an Apache Tomcat server. Live demo can be seen [here](http://18.220.210.86:8080/). 

### Usage
After downloading, build a working war or exploded war and place into the tomcat root directory.
